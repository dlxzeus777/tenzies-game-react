# Tenzies React App

## The object of the game:

- The object of the game is to be the first player to roll the same number with all ten of your dice. All players will make their first roll at the same time. Players will select a number to go for, and set aside those dice. The other dice are re-rolled.

## In this game you can:

- See how many rolls you're on.
- If you refresh the page the number of rolls and the dices you selected stay the same because I used localStorage.

## About the app:

- This simple app was made with React, I tried to use everything I learned about React: useState, props, ternary operator, useEffect. Also learned how to use localStorage so I just had to implement it somehow in this app!


## Goal:

- Try to finish the game with low number of rolls.
